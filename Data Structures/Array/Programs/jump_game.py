"""
Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made 
forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the 
end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, they cannot move through 
that element. If the end isnâ€™t reachable, return -1.

Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 9 -> 9)
